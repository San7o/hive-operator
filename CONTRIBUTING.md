# Contributing

This is a free and open source project under the GPLv2
license. Contributions are always welcomed and are a fundamental
pillar of the project. If you find issues, or have feature requests,
or want to contribute to the current issues, feel free to do so.

Development happens on github, you can find open issues in the
[issues](https://github.com/San7o/hive-operator/issues) page. Here you
can see if a problem was already encountered, discuss possible
solutions and read future plains in feature-tracking issues.

If you want to send a patch, please:

- fork the repository
- move to a new branch
  - give your branch a meaningful, clear and short name
- make your changes
- commit them to your branch with a short and meaningful name, prepend
  the commit line by the type of contribution like `fix`, `feature` /
  `feat`, `docs` etc.
- create a pull request towards main
  - the title should start with the type of contribution, like `fix`,
    `feature` or `feat`, `docs` or whatever you think is appropriate.
  - by reading the title, other people should clearly understand what
    is your pull request about
  - write a good description of the changes; this is incredibly
    important if you want to have a good review and your contributions
    to be merged in the codebase. Writing a good description is as
    important as the patch itself, nobody will want to review a PR that
    can't even explain what it is about.

Happy hacking!
